# Markdown Preview

This is an extremely simple app that I wrote early on when learning React. Inputted text gets updated live in the Preview section through the use of React hooks and the library Marked.

Check it out [here](https://www.sunkenworld.com/markdown-app).

This is just the submodule containing the front-end React 'src' source folder. To see the entire project, go to [this repository](https://github.com/mackenziewritescode/markdown-app).
