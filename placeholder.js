## A little site made using React.
### It uses Marked.js.

It uses the markup language **Markdown** to... well, ~~markdown~~ _markup_ the text.

You can do all sorts of things, like:

\`\`\`
    write code between backticks.
\`\`\`

It's also good for

While I have your attention, here's a bit of info on this little app inside of a block quote:

> Everything on this page was coded by hand. No copying and pasting in site.
>
> Inputted text gets updated live in the Preview section through the use of React and the library Marked.
>
> The layout of this app was designed using CSS grids for a clean look and responsive layout. If possible, try resizing the window to see how the headers snap from being written vertically and to the left of the content to being on top when the viewport gets narrow.
>
> The buttons used to expand and collapse the windows use React's state to set the classes of various elements, as well as change the grid layout.
